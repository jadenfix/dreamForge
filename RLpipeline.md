Below is a deeply-sophisticated RL pipeline you can bolt onto DreamForge—one that mirrors Moondream’s own curriculum-plus-RLHF approach, scales across arbitrary image domains, and yet remains as easy to invoke as pushing code to Vercel:

⸻

1. New “Training” Page (Prompt + Reward → Train)

UI Wireframe (/train)

<div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto py-12 space-y-8">
  <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">Fine-Tune Your Model</h1>

  {/* 1. Select or Upload Dataset */}
  <DatasetUploader />

  {/* 2. Pick or Build Reward Function */}
  <RewardBuilder />  {/* from previous design */}

  {/* 3. Configure Curriculum Stages */}
  <CurriculumConfigurator />

  {/* 4. Launch Training Job */}
  <LaunchButton />

  {/* 5. Job Monitor */}
  <JobMonitor />     {/* realtime logs, progress bar, charts */}
</div>

2. Under-the-Hood: Curriculum + RLHF Orchestrator

A. Curriculum Stages
	1.	Stage 1 – Supervised Warm-Start
• Train on broad, generic image datasets (e.g. COCO, OpenImages)
• Quick convergence: 1–2 epochs
	2.	Stage 2 – Domain Adaptation
• Your uploaded/selected dataset (e.g. medical scans, retail shelves)
• Medium-scale supervised fine-tuning (3–5 epochs)
	3.	Stage 3 – Reward-Driven RLHF
• Inject the custom reward function from RewardBuilder
• Run a lightweight RL loop (e.g. PPO via Ray RLlib or Stable Baselines3)
• Optimize model for your business metric (IoU, F1, custom JS snipped reward)
	4.	Stage 4 – Evaluation & Model Packaging
• Validate on held-out set
• Export quantized, 4-bit model for Moondream Station or cloud serving

This mirrors exactly what Jay described: “curriculum-based training approach… then RL at the end.”

B. Orchestration Service
	•	Next.js API Route POST /api/train
	1.	Validate inputs: dataset pointer, rewardFnId, hyperparams
	2.	Enqueue job in Mongo + BullMQ (Redis) queue
	3.	Return jobId to UI
	•	Worker (Node.js + BullMQ)
	1.	Pull job → spawn a Python container (via Docker or Modal)
	2.	Mount data (S3/Cloud Storage path) + reward JS file
	3.	Run:

python run_pipeline.py \
  --stage1 --stage2 --stage3 \
  --reward reward.js \
  --output ./models/job-${JOB_ID}


	4.	Stream logs back into Mongo job log collection
	5.	On completion, write model metadata (size, eval metrics) to Mongo

	•	Python Pipeline (run_pipeline.py)
	•	Uses Ray RLlib for distributed PPO
	•	Hugging Face Accelerate for mixed-precision
	•	Curriculum config is JSON-driven
	•	RLHF stage calls reward(out, gt) in reward.js inside a sandbox (e.g. PyMiniRacer)

⸻

3. Job Monitor & Metrics
	•	JobMonitor Component polls /api/train/status?jobId=
	•	Displays:
	•	Progress bar (0–100%) across 4 stages
	•	Live logs (stdout/stderr) in collapsible panel
	•	Training curves for loss, reward vs. step (plotted via Recharts)
	•	Final metrics: accuracy, IoU, custom reward score

⸻

4. One-Click “Vercel-Style” Invocation
	•	Deployable CLI:

npx dreamforge train \
  --dataset gs://my-bucket/images/ \
  --reward MyCustomEcomReward \
  --epochs 5 3 2


	•	GitHub Integration: push a dreamforge.config.json to repo → GitHub Action auto-triggers /api/train with that config → preview branch shows training status.

⸻

5. Variety of Image Types
	•	DatasetUploader supports local ZIP upload, S3/GS links, or Mongo-stored GridFS.
	•	CurriculumConfigurator can load presets (e.g. “Medical Scan”, “Retail Shelf”, “Traffic Camera”) with recommended hyperparams.
	•	RewardBuilder JS can operate on any bounding-box or mask format—so object detection, segmentation, keypoint tasks all covered.

⸻

6. Zero Ops & Free-Tier Friendly
	•	Worker uses on-demand serverless (Modal or AWS Fargate with free credits).
	•	Storage: small datasets in Mongo or free S3 tier; temporary training artifacts auto-cleaned.
	•	Compute: lightweight RL loops (few episodes, small batch sizes) tuned for fast completion within free quotas.

By layering in a true curriculum + RLHF pipeline, rich job monitoring, and one-click, zero-config training, DreamForge becomes not just a playground but a full-blown platform—exactly the “Vercel for VLMs” Jay is building.
